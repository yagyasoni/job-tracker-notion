# 🛩️ JobPilot — Track Your Career Moves with Notion

**JobPilot** is a Chrome extension that helps you streamline your job search by scraping job details (like title, company, location, and description) from any job posting URL and saving them directly into your Notion job tracker.

## 🤔 Why I Built This

Applying to jobs across various career websites was becoming a nightmare. I often:

- Lost track of whether I applied or got referred
- Spent hours searching through emails
- Had no single place to manage job applications

So I built **JobPilot** to fix that problem for myself — and now you can use it too.
