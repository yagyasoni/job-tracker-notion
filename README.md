## Why I Built This

While applying for jobs through company career websites, I consistently faced a frustrating problem:

**The Challenge**: Company career websites mostly have long response times. When responses finally arrive in your email, you have to search through your inbox to remember which job you applied for. Unlike LinkedIn Easy Apply or other platforms that keep application history, direct company applications aren't readily tracked.

**The Reality**: When you're applying to multiple companies simultaneously, it becomes nearly impossible to keep track of all applications. You end up wasting precious time trying to find job details and remember which positions you've applied for.

**The Solution**: JobSync eliminates this time-wasting search process by instantly capturing and organizing all your job applications in one centralized Notion database.

## Supported Platforms

- Greenhouse.io
- Lever.co  
- BambooHR
- Workable
- SmartRecruiters
- JazzHR
- Most company career pages

## Troubleshooting

**Extension won't load**: Ensure you built the project (`npm run build`) and loaded the `dist` folder

**Scraping fails**: Verify you're on the actual job posting page and the site is supported

**Notion sync issues**: Check API key, Database ID, and ensure database is shared with integration
